########### TODO #########
Currently working on improvements in proxy only period
- 20CR type of screening einbauen. does it make sense with proxies and forward model?

- Does precip forward model work? T and TP exp. look the same
  Yes, precip is only account for in Petra35 but not PAGES nor Petra_full
  ADD!
  
- Add removal of duplicate proxy data, considering from various archives, too

- ADD doc time localization

- index_correlation/RE plots regions + NAO, PNA, etc. (land_only=F?)
- index time series plots regions + NAO, PNA, etc.

OK- is PAGES year wrong??? because previous PAGES data was Okt-Sep and new file is Apr. to Mar.
  I (JF) believe it works properly. However PAGES data is treated as temp. sensitive only!
  and there may be duplicated in PAGES but not recalibrated, at the moment both are assimilated!
OK- vind.anom missing in prepplot! is it needed?
OK- assimilation of many records makes it very slow!!!
OK-  write out residuals to log file
  already saved in calibrate$var_residu
OK  should work if ind_ECHAM=T, check and remove switch if it works to always create these plots
OK- Nevin's screening ansehen!
OK- try mixed signal  
OK- 20CR validation testen
  switched on in current exp., let's see if it works? YES, but much slower!
OK- are we using full or screened-by-Raphi(FDR) PAGES data and which version number?
  full version, but I checked FDR screened records now! Still many probably prec sensitive in US SW



This file serves as an overview of all experiments (e.g. date, explanation, name).
With this it should be easier to find plots, data etc. from former experiments.

"NTREND_tree_prox_only"              # compare NTREND vs PAGES vs Petra by JF 2019/01
  # results: same as nevin's version
  #          only tiny update
  # possible solutions: increase model error covariance
  #                     reduce observation error 
"NTREND_tree_prox_only_0.5timesR"    # half observation error 
  # results: update only a tiny bit larger, RE is little worse
"NTREND_tree_prox_only_0.1timesR"    # even smaller obs error experiment
  # results: really larger update, i.e. system works
  #          however, corr only little better and RE in centr. Asia worse
"NTREND_tree_prox_only_1.2inflation" # increase model error covariance by inflation
  # results: much worse because model spread is mostly inflated more than proxies reduce it
  
"PAGES_tree_prox_only"               # compare NTREND vs PAGES vs Petra by JF 2019/01
  # results: same as nevin's
  #          generally good skill, but Asia and SW US neg. skill, probably poor or precip proxies
  #          too much update in regions where many proxies get assimilated, to little in others
  # possible solutions: average proxy data per grid cell to increase signal to noise ratio
  #                     more advanced would be a weighted proxy average
"PAGES_tree_prox_only_avg_per_grid"  # does the first solution

"Petra_tree_prox_only"               # compare NTREND vs PAGES vs Petra by JF 2019/01

############### OTHER THINGS TO DO: ########################
"Check Indices calculation, especially the last few (DIMI, PAO, ITCZ), which also were taken from Stefans Reanalysis (Not quite the same)"
"Improve plot_echam4 function: Some plots still only work with plot_echam (1)"
"Add a Switch to plot_echam4, such that can be chosen in advance whether the plot shall be saved or shown in the graphics device of Rstudio"
"To visualise yearly output a solution is also needed for plot_echam4: Maybe just duplicate the yearly output to pretend like there were two seasons?"

################# NOTES ##########################
How to delete branches from github locally and remotely with bash:

go to directory reuse_git (where your git file is: cd /user......)

git remote prune origin -n  # lists deleted branch on github
git remote prune origin	    # deletes it (remote)

git fetch -p && git branch -vv | awk '/: gone]/{print $1}' | xargs git branch    # deletes branch (local) evtl add branchname after branch

Experiments/Runs:
 2017-07-27 climcal4/scratch4 1600-2005 with corrected 71-year anom. input data
   DETAILS THAT WERE SOLVED:
   - ti=which(floor(realprox.allts$time)>=(cyr-35) &
       floor(realprox.allts$time)<=(cyr+35))
     has probably no effect because proxy data are already cut in time before if code is 
     run for short periods (syr to eyr). I.e. all my results are with assimilated ~20-year 
     anomalies instead of the desired 70-year anomalies
   - check syr and eyr in "mean(vtmp[j,,i])"
   - calibrate.allts AND proxies.allts COMMENTED AS NOT NEEDED AND ALL DATA COVER DIFF. PERIODS
   - pspline package commented on climcal4 because not available for installed r version
   - check difference between old and new version!!!

 2017-07-31 climcal4/scratch4 1941-1970 check error covar from climatology
   instead of current year only to have less spurious correlation that were due to 
   small 30 member ensemble. 
 - 50% and 100% error covar from climatology
 - WITH and WITHOUT localization
 - Now very 7th field from 1600-1900 period and 30 member ens.
   which roughly equals a 500 member ensemble
 - run tps_only because super slow otherwise (1 year in ~2 days)

 Planned Experiments
 2. - Paleodata only, NO instr. (after adding N-TREND, PAGES CORALS and more hist. DOCUMENTS)
 3. - all year as one big ensemble (Hakim style)
 4. - 60 ens. mem. vs 30 mem.
 5. - estimate obs. err. (see below)
 6. - check if assim. data out of ens. spread!
 7. - check proposal!

 - change to 12-months state vector to assimilate corals???
 - or use n-trend instead of pages, 
 - or somehow only corals from pages as ice cores do not help
 FAVORIT: N-TREND, PAGES CORALS and more hist. DOCUMENTS

 estimate observation errors using "Simultaneous estimation of covariance inflation and 
 observation errors within an ensemble Kalman filter"
 Hong Li, Eugenia Kalnay and Takemasa Miyoshi

 change every2grid  to lowres, i.e. interpolation
 library(akima)
 interpp(x=x-coor_verctor,y=y-coor_vector,z=z-values,xo=x_out-coor_vector,yo=y_out-coor_vector)

FIX:
 strange no of input data 1641-1643  
 [37,] 1639     0   30   164   35  129
 [38,] 1640     0   30   164   35  129
 [39,] 1641  1668   30    50   19   31
 [40,] 1642  1668   30    50   19   31
 [41,] 1643  1668   30    50   19   31
 [42,] 1644     0   30   164   35  129
 [43,] 1645     0   30   164   35  129

 why do mxd input data drop around 1650?

 JONAS IDEEN:
 instr. mitteln, aber fehler nicht reduzieren
 proxies und instr. assimilieren damit wenn einzelne monate NAs haben 
 immner noch proxy infos eingehen

 Olivia Nov. 2015: 
 Z500 and temp. anom. at same place = radiation is cause
 Z500 and temp. anom. shifted = advection is cause
 precip anom. in % instead of mm, otherwise just tropics visible

 current code in R only without Fortran!!!
