This file serves as an overview of all experiments (e.g. date, explanation, name).
With this it should be easier to find plots, data etc. from former experiments.

"mon_from_seas"               # can we get monthly res from seasonal proxies, 
                              # maybe idealized pseudoproxy experiment
"EKF400_v1.4_new_error"       # run with new error covar estimates from Luca 
"PAGES_2_0_full"              # complete PAGES proxy database version 2.0
"PAGES_2_0_screened"          # screened version of PAGES DB 2.0, just good asian rec.
"all_data_2017"               # include ISTI, Petra's TRW and more docu and ... data

############### OTHER THINGS TO DO: ########################
"Check Indices calculation, especially the last few (DIMI, PAO, ITCZ), which also were taken from Stefans Reanalysis (Not quite the same)"
"Improve plot_echam4 function: Some plots still only work with plot_echam (1)"
"Add a Switch to plot_echam4, such that can be chosen in advance whether the plot shall be saved or shown in the graphics device of Rstudio"
"To visualise yearly output a solution is also needed for plot_echam4: Maybe just duplicate the yearly output to pretend like there were two seasons?"





################ DONE: ###################
"proxies_only_ntrend_pages_petra_tps_tree_only"
date: June 2018
Remade experiment with newest version: combined tree proxies

"proxies_only_ntrend_pages_tps_ **tree_only **tree_coral"
date: June 2018
With vs without coral data.

"proxies_only_pval99_no_forc_big_ens_changing_ncovar30"
date: June 2018
Ntrend, Pages, Petras tree data screened by 99% confidence, no forcings with 30 random ens members (changing every year)

"proxies_only_average_per_grid_"
date: May 2018
Makes averages of the tree widths within one echam gridcell. Then calculates regression. (Pages, ntrend and petras data are used)

"proxies_only_trw_petra_tps_aic_pval"
date: May 2018
First chooses the best subperiod as growthperiod of the tree with the AIC value. Then calculates regression and only takes significant ones

"proxies_only_trw_petra_tps_fullmodel_pval90 **95 **99"
date: April/May 2018
Screening the trees: only take significant regression models (pvalue of f statistic > alpha = 0.1, 0.05, 0.01)

"proxies_only_PETRA ***_NTREND ****_PAGES"
date: April 2018
Same as pages vs. ntrend, but with even more trees in petra's data

"proxies_only_NTREND_var_residu4"
date: March 2018
Give the trees more weight by dividing the residuals of the regression model by 2 or 4 or 10

"proxies_only_PAGES_vs_NTREND"
date: February 2018
Compared Pages trw with ntrend trw (whether it's better to let experts choose the trees or use all possible trees)

################# NOTES ##########################
How to delete branches from github locally and remotely with bash:

go to directory reuse_git (where your git file is: cd /user......)

git remote prune origin -n  # lists deleted branch on github
git remote prune origin	    # deletes it (remote)

git fetch -p && git branch -vv | awk '/: gone]/{print $1}' | xargs git branch    # deletes branch (local) evtl add branchname after branch

Experiments/Runs:
 2017-07-27 climcal4/scratch4 1600-2005 with corrected 71-year anom. input data
   DETAILS THAT WERE SOLVED:
   - ti=which(floor(realprox.allts$time)>=(cyr-35) &
       floor(realprox.allts$time)<=(cyr+35))
     has probably no effect because proxy data are already cut in time before if code is 
     run for short periods (syr to eyr). I.e. all my results are with assimilated ~20-year 
     anomalies instead of the desired 70-year anomalies
   - check syr and eyr in "mean(vtmp[j,,i])"
   - calibrate.allts AND proxies.allts COMMENTED AS NOT NEEDED AND ALL DATA COVER DIFF. PERIODS
   - pspline package commented on climcal4 because not available for installed r version
   - check difference between old and new version!!!

 2017-07-31 climcal4/scratch4 1941-1970 check error covar from climatology
   instead of current year only to have less spurious correlation that were due to 
   small 30 member ensemble. 
 - 50% and 100% error covar from climatology
 - WITH and WITHOUT localization
 - Now very 7th field from 1600-1900 period and 30 member ens.
   which roughly equals a 500 member ensemble
 - run tps_only because super slow otherwise (1 year in ~2 days)

 Planned Experiments
 2. - Paleodata only, NO instr. (after adding N-TREND, PAGES CORALS and more hist. DOCUMENTS)
 3. - all year as one big ensemble (Hakim style)
 4. - 60 ens. mem. vs 30 mem.
 5. - estimate obs. err. (see below)
 6. - check if assim. data out of ens. spread!
 7. - check proposal!

 - change to 12-months state vector to assimilate corals???
 - or use n-trend instead of pages, 
 - or somehow only corals from pages as ice cores do not help
 FAVORIT: N-TREND, PAGES CORALS and more hist. DOCUMENTS

 estimate observation errors using "Simultaneous estimation of covariance inflation and 
 observation errors within an ensemble Kalman filter"
 Hong Li, Eugenia Kalnay and Takemasa Miyoshi

 change every2grid  to lowres, i.e. interpolation
 library(akima)
 interpp(x=x-coor_verctor,y=y-coor_vector,z=z-values,xo=x_out-coor_vector,yo=y_out-coor_vector)

FIX:
 strange no of input data 1641-1643  
 [37,] 1639     0   30   164   35  129
 [38,] 1640     0   30   164   35  129
 [39,] 1641  1668   30    50   19   31
 [40,] 1642  1668   30    50   19   31
 [41,] 1643  1668   30    50   19   31
 [42,] 1644     0   30   164   35  129
 [43,] 1645     0   30   164   35  129

 why do mxd input data drop around 1650?

 JONAS IDEEN:
 instr. mitteln, aber fehler nicht reduzieren
 proxies und instr. assimilieren damit wenn einzelne monate NAs haben 
 immner noch proxy infos eingehen

 Olivia Nov. 2015: 
 Z500 and temp. anom. at same place = radiation is cause
 Z500 and temp. anom. shifted = advection is cause
 precip anom. in % instead of mm, otherwise just tropics visible

 current code in R only without Fortran!!!
 ATTENTION: to use the faster fortran EnSRF routine execute on the command line:
 R CMD SHLIB EnSRF.f95 uncomment/comment related code in EnSRF_functions.R
 R --arch=x86_64 CMD SHLIB EnSRF.f95 # to compile EnSRF.f95 on 64bit MAC
